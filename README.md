# java-pacman
Pacman made with java and greenfoot as a university assignment for Vilnius University Software Engineering programme.

As I do not have the right to the images, I have not uploaded them here. They can be replaced with your own images. Refer to the file "Missing images" for more details.

The game can be run by downloading greenfoot and opening the project using it.
